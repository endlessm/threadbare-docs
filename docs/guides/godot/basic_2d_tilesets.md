This is an introductory tile set guide for the development of a Threadbare
StoryQuest, but could also be helpful to anyone looking to explore basic tileset
creation for games in Godot. It covers the first steps of basic tileset creation
and implementation for games in Godot. You'll learn how to use the free pixel
art tool Piskel to draw a simple tileset, import it into Godot, and set up
physics layers for collision detection. It also covers creating terrain sets
that enable auto-tiling, so the game engine can automatically choose the right
tiles when you're building levels quickly.
